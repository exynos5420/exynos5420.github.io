        <p class="center"><b>About the Exynos5420 Team</b></p>
        <p>We are an international group of Exynos 5420 developers that decided that trying to fix our own devices by ourselves was a waste of 
		energy when other developers were having the same issues so we decided to pull together and work as a team. We formed an informal group 
		that started with only five members.  The group has since tripled to 19 members with 12 core members leading the development of the Exynos 
		platform. As a group we have fixed issues that have plagued all of us for months.  We fixed the camera, rotation distortions, setup settings,
		fingerprint scanner, and more. One of the goals we wanted to accomplish was unifying the device tree and kernel as our devices arso similar
		that it was worth unifying. We have recently released an app to utilize the full power of our Deathly kernel.  As a group we discussed making
		a ROM just for our devices because we had the talent and mindset to make it a reality.</p>
        <p>All of the sources can be publicly viewed through GitHub. You can stop by the public Gerrit to submit patches of any type
            or help translate our work to your language through our Crowdin project</p>

        <h1 class="title">Mission Statement</h1>
        <p>The mission of the Exynos5420 Team and LiquidDeathOS is to provide a stable, optimized, and well balanced OS for Samsung 
		Exynos devices.</p>
    </paper-card>
	
	<paper-card>
        <h1 class="title">Purpose Statement</h1>
        <p>Since Samsung Exynos is not supported in CAF, and AOSP has limited support for it, we, as a group of developers, decided to
		create an OS that would take full advantage of the Exynos platform ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ . The purpose of this group is to provide an OS where we do not have
		to use ugly device hacks, to fix things caused by ROM's that are only supporting CAF devices. </p>

        <h1 class="title">LiquidDeathOS Mission Statement</h1>
        <p>Years after the death of LiquidSmooth, Sean Hoyt, (the LiquidSmooth lead dev) has returned to the ROM game, along with the Exynos5420,
		team to bring greatness to our beloved Exynos5420 tablets (and note 3), out of the ashes of the fallen LiquidSmooth ROM. LiquidDeathOS
		is super optimized for the Exynos5420. In fact right now it is so optimized that it won't even boot on non-exynos devices :) LD is 
		AOSP based (⌐■_■) , and is only for Exynos devices (it's even more optimized than lineage).</p>
