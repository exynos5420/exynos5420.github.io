      "As was mentioned in the previous post I would announce the teams new ROM as soon as we had anything to share. Well, we do. We have \rcontacted Roger Truttmann (Roger.T) to make us some graphics for our new ROM. Wait? Have a told you guys what the name of the ROM is yet? I \rguess I haven't:p As a team one night we were discussing names for our brand new ROM. Sean suggested Echo OS and Martin suggested Full Moon OS. \rNow we had a problem;) We liked both names, so we discussed which name was easier to market and again we were at a stalemate. Wiley suggested a \rcombination of the two names, Echoing Moon OS (EMOS). We all like that name and it took the best parts of the two original ideas and combined \rthem into a great name.",
      "",
      "Some maybe wondering why we decided to make another ROM. Well, we were not happy with how LD ended up and it did not accomplish what we \rwanted. So we decided to go another route this time. We are going to start with AOSP and add CAF on top just like how Dirty Unicorn (DU) handles \rCAF. This will allow us to easily added QCOM devices later on after we get the ROM stable for Exynos devices. Speaking of CAF devices. Darragh and \rWiley both got OP5's so you can count on that device being supported;)",
